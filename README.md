CS 344 Program 3

To  compile use gcc -std=gnu99 -o smallsh program3.c 
This will create smallsh which you'll run by simply calling smallsh in the command line. 

The program will exit only when "exit" is entered.

The test script is interesting, I think I'm good to go. But sometimes the output on the test script doesn't match 
what I see when I manually execute my program and commands. This was also my third time wading into C and it shows.
This program is not pretty but it does work, so... yeah. I could do a lot better if I did it again lol.
