CS 344 Program 3

To  compile use gcc -std=gnu99 -o smallsh program3.c 
This will create smallsh which you'll run by simply calling smallsh in the command line. 

The program will exit only when "exit" is entered.

# Note:
This project proved to be execptionally difficult as I had learn C about 3-4 weeks prior.
I was coming from Python and my only exposure to memory allocation is writing a couple programs 
in masm. Every time I struggled in this program the question was always, "Is it because I don't 
get the concept? Or do I just not get C?" I would say it was a coin toss which one it was and I 
think if I had been familiar with C this really wouldn't have been so difficult. To get around 
a lot of my problems with C I took a couple short cuts, most notably the global variables and 
functions that do fifteen different things. This program is not a marvel of engineering. While
I hate them, I struggle to pass values between functions. This isn't good work, but I don't know 
what else I was supposed to do, I started within two days of this being assigned, went to so many
office hours, emailed professors, watched/read tutorials. I worked on it every day and so much of 
my diffculty comes down to not knowing C. Trying to communicate higher level topics in a new language
was rough! If you want to give me a hard time about how I wrote this program (it's shit.) come teach me.
